# Components

There are a number of additional components that are exported by this workflow package, including Core components and Utility components.

## Core Components

Core components provide core functionality related to the workflows in this package. It's expected that you will use them in most cases.

- [RegistrationWorkflow](https://github.com/etn-ccis/blui-react-workflows/tree/master/login-workflow/docs/components/registration-workflow.md)
- [ChangePasswordDialog](https://github.com/etn-ccis/blui-react-workflows/tree/master/login-workflow/docs/components/change-password-dialog.md)

## Utility Components

These utility components are used as sub-components to build some of our other screens and components. If you have a need for them elsewhere in your application, we export them for your convenience. These are most useful if you are creating custom screens to inject into the Registration Workflow.
