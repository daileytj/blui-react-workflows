# Screens

Each of the screens in both the Login / Authentication  and Registration workflows is exported as a standalone component that can be customized or used in your own custom-defined flows.

> These screen components must live inside of an appropriate `AuthContextProvider` or `RegistrationContextProvider`. If you want to use the components outside of these providers, you can import the `___Base` version of the screens instead, which are pure components driven exclusively by their props.

The following screen components are available:
